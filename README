##Communication protocol:

# Client:

* Receive `sid` upon connection.
* Send user input to server through `userAction` channel.
* Receive data from server through `tick` channel. The data is in the form:

    {
      blocks: [ny][nx],
      currentPieces: {
        sid: {
          x: int,
          y: int,
          color: {}
        },
      ]
    }

* Render the game.

# Server:

* Accept client connection and assign `sids`.
* Handle game logic.
* Broadcast game state in every frame.
